Note: node_modules weren't uploaded but are necessary for this project

About the faker.js file, to execute the scripts with faker data you'll have to uncomment line 24 and 28.

About the token, since it's an environment variable, you'll have to set/export your own by using the following commands depending on your OS:

export TOKEN="MYTESTINGTOKEN"
set TOKEN= "MYTESTINGTOKEN"
setx TOKEN "MYTESTINGTOKEN"

Thanks for this workshop!! It's been a challenging experience.
